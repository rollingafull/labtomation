## üéØ Overview

Labtomation automates the creation of a **management VM** that serves as the foundation for your homelab or small business infrastructure. This management VM comes pre-configured with essential DevOps tools (Ansible, Terraform, Vault, Jenkins) and acts as your central control plane for infrastructure orchestration.

### What is Labtomation?

Think of Labtomation as your infrastructure bootstrap. Instead of manually installing and configuring multiple tools across different systems, Labtomation:

1. **Creates** a management VM on Proxmox with modern Q35 + EFI configuration
2. **Installs** industry-standard DevOps tools automatically
3. **Configures** everything to work together seamlessly
4. **Prepares** your environment for infrastructure automation

From this management VM, you'll be able to:

- Define infrastructure as code using **Terraform**
- Automate configuration management with **Ansible**
- Store secrets securely in **HashiCorp Vault**
- Implement CI/CD pipelines with **Jenkins**

## üöÄ Current Status

### Connecting to Your VM

```bash
# SSH into management VM (keys are in current directory)
ssh -i ./id_ed25519 labtomation@<vm-ip>

# Access Vault UI
http://<vm-ip>:8200

# Access Jenkins UI
http://<vm-ip>:8080
```
